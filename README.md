## Optimized Link Structure

The ZAO Nexus V5 uses an optimized link structure stored in `links-new.json` that provides several advantages over the traditional approach:

### Key Features

1. **Centralized Link Definitions**: Each link has a unique ID to eliminate duplication across categories
2. **Enhanced Metadata**: Includes creation dates, popularity metrics, and health status
3. **Comprehensive Tagging**: Supports tag relationships, visual styling, and frequency metrics
4. **Hierarchical Categories**: Categories reference link IDs instead of duplicating link data
5. **Version Tracking**: Includes schema version and last updated timestamp
6. **Collection Statistics**: Provides overall metrics about the link collection

### Schema Structure

```

### Adapter System

To maintain compatibility with the existing application components, we use an adapter system:

1. **Data Storage**: The optimized structure is stored in `links-new.json`
2. **Conversion**: The `adapter-for-app.js` script converts this to the application-compatible format
3. **Application Use**: The application continues to use `links.json` (generated from the optimized structure)

### Benefits

- **Reduced Data Duplication**: Links are defined once and referenced by ID
- **Improved Data Integrity**: Changes to a link are automatically reflected everywhere
- **Enhanced Metadata**: More comprehensive tracking of link health and popularity
- **Better Tag Management**: Centralized tag definitions with relationship mapping
- **Easier Maintenance**: Simplified structure for adding, updating, and removing links

## Key Files

- `src/data/links-new.json` - Optimized link data structure with centralized definitions
- `src/data/links.json` - Application-compatible link data (generated from the optimized structure)
- `src/data/links-structure-example.json` - Example of the optimized structure format
- `src/types/links.ts` - TypeScript types for link data
- `src/types/ethereum.d.ts` - TypeScript types for Ethereum interactions

## Multi-Chain Token Balance Checking Implementation Guide

### Overview

The ZAO Nexus portal implements a robust multi-chain token balance checking system that allows users to connect their wallets and verify token balances across different blockchain networks. The implementation checks for:

- **$ZAO tokens** on the **Optimism** network
- **$LOANZ tokens** on the **Base** network

Users gain access to the portal if they hold at least 0.1 tokens of either type.

### Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **Wallet Hook (`use-wallet.ts`)**: Central hook that manages wallet connection and token balance checking
2. **Wallet Store**: Zustand store with persistence middleware for maintaining wallet state
3. **Wallet Connect Component**: UI component for wallet connection
4. **Token Balance Display**: UI components for showing token balances

### Implementation Best Practices

#### 1. Provider Management

```typescript
// Cache providers to avoid creating new instances on every check
let providers = {
  optimism: null as ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider | null,
  base: null as ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider | null
};

// Cache contracts to avoid creating new instances on every check
let contracts = {
  zao: null as ethers.Contract | null,
  loanz: null as ethers.Contract | null
};

// Initialize providers and contracts
const initializeProviders = () => {
  if (!providers.optimism) {
    providers.optimism = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(OPTIMISM_RPC);
  }
  if (!providers.base) {
    providers.base = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(BASE_RPC);
  }
  if (!contracts.zao && providers.optimism) {
    contracts.zao = new ethers.Contract(ZAO_TOKEN_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, providers.optimism);
  }
  if (!contracts.loanz && providers.base) {
    contracts.loanz = new ethers.Contract(LOANZ_TOKEN_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, providers.base);
  }
};
```

#### 2. Efficient Balance Checking

```typescript
checkTokenBalance: async () => {
  const { address, lastChecked } = get();
  if (!address) return;
  
  // Throttle balance checks to prevent too many RPC calls
  if (Date.now() - lastChecked < 10000) return; // 10 seconds cooldown
  set({ lastChecked: Date.now() });
  
  initializeProviders();
  
  // Use Promise.allSettled to check both balances in parallel
  const results = await Promise.allSettled([
    // Check ZAO balance on Optimism
    (async () => {
      try {
        const balance = await contracts.zao.balanceOf(address);
        return { balance: formatBalance(balance), hasToken: balance.gte(ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")) };
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error checking ZAO balance:", error);
        return { balance: '0', hasToken: false };
      }
    })(),
    
    // Check LOANZ balance on Base
    (async () => {
      try {
        const balance = await contracts.loanz.balanceOf(address);
        return { balance: formatBalance(balance), hasToken: balance.gte(ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")) };
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error checking LOANZ balance:", error);
        return { balance: '0', hasToken: false };
      }
    })()
  ]);
  
  // Update state with results
  if (results[0].status === 'fulfilled') set({ zaoBalance: results[0].value.balance });
  if (results[1].status === 'fulfilled') set({ loanzBalance: results[1].value.balance });
  set({ hasTokens: (results[0].status === 'fulfilled' && results[0].value.hasToken) || 
                   (results[1].status === 'fulfilled' && results[1].value.hasToken) });
}
```

#### 3. Wallet Connection Event Handling

```typescript
// Set up event listeners for account and chain changes
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.ethereum) {
  window.ethereum.on('accountsChanged', async (accounts: string[]) => {
    if (accounts.length === 0) {
      // User disconnected their wallet
      disconnect();
    } else {
      // User switched accounts
      set({ address: accounts[0] });
      await checkTokenBalance();
    }
  });

  window.ethereum.on('chainChanged', async () => {
    // Refresh token balances when chain changes
    await checkTokenBalance();
  });
}
```

#### 4. State Persistence

```typescript
export const useWalletStore = create<WalletState>(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // State and methods here
    }),
    {
      name: 'wallet-storage', // unique name for localStorage
      partialize: (state) => ({ 
        address: state.address,
        isConnected: state.isConnected,
        zaoBalance: state.zaoBalance,
        loanzBalance: state.loanzBalance,
        hasTokens: state.hasTokens
      })
    }
  )
);
```

### Workflow

1. **User Connects Wallet**:
   - User clicks "Connect Wallet" button
   - Application requests wallet connection via MetaMask
   - On successful connection, wallet address is stored

2. **Balance Checking**:
   - Application initializes providers and contracts if not already done
   - Balances for both tokens are checked in parallel
   - Results are stored in the wallet state

3. **Token Gating**:
   - If user has sufficient tokens (‚â• 0.1 of either token), access is granted
   - Token balances are displayed in the UI

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Main UI**:
   - Integrate the token checker components into the main Nexus UI
   - Ensure consistent styling and user experience

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement RPC request batching/multicall for more efficient blockchain queries
   - Add caching mechanisms to reduce redundant balance checks

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Add unit tests for token balance checker utility functions
   - Add integration tests for wallet connection and token checking flows
   - Test with various wallet states and network conditions

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Implement more detailed error messages for specific failure scenarios
   - Add recovery mechanisms for temporary RPC failures

5. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Support additional tokens and networks as needed
   - Add transaction history for token transfers
   - Implement token price information

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Application listens for account and chain changes
   - Balances are rechecked when these events occur

5. **State Persistence**:
   - Wallet state is persisted in localStorage
   - User remains connected across page refreshes

### Troubleshooting

- **Balance Not Updating**: Check browser console for errors. Ensure RPC endpoints are functioning.
- **Connection Issues**: Verify MetaMask is installed and unlocked. Check for network connectivity.
- **Performance Problems**: If balance checks are slow, consider increasing the throttle time.

# Run the batch import utility directly
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/batch-import-links.ts --file=path/to/links.csv --type=csv --generate-tags --dry-run

# Or use the admin CLI
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/admin-cli.ts import --file=path/to/links.csv --type=csv --generate-tags
```

#### CSV Format

The CSV file should have the following columns:

```csv
title,url,description,category,subcategory,tags
"Link Title","https://example.com","Link description","Category","Subcategory","tag1,tag2,tag3"
```

### Auto-Tagging Utility

The auto-tagging utility analyzes all links in the database and adds relevant tags based on content analysis, domain extraction, and keyword matching.

#### Usage

```bash
# Run the auto-tagging utility
node auto-tag-all-links.js
```

#### Features

- **Domain Extraction**: Extracts meaningful tags from URL domains
- **Keyword Matching**: Identifies relevant keywords in titles and descriptions
- **Category Suggestion**: Suggests appropriate categories based on tags
- **Tag Deduplication**: Ensures no duplicate tags are added
- **Web3-Specific Detection**: Special handling for blockchain and Web3 content

#### Options

- `--file`: Path to the CSV or JSON file containing links to import (required)
- `--type`: File type, either 'csv' or 'json' (required)
- `--generate-tags`: Generate tags for links using AI or local fallback (optional)
- `--dry-run`: Run the import without saving changes (optional)
- `--dataset`: Specify which dataset to use (default: 'default') (optional)

#### CSV Format

The CSV file should have the following columns:

```
title,url,description,category,subcategory,tags
"Example Link","https://example.com","This is an example","Resources","Tools","example,tool"
```

#### JSON Format

The JSON file should contain an array of link objects:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Example Link",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "description": "This is an example",
    "category": "Resources",
    "subcategory": "Tools",
    "tags": ["example", "tool"]
  }
]
```

### Recategorization Utility

The recategorization utility helps suggest and apply category/subcategory changes based on tags.

#### Usage

```bash
# Run the recategorization utility directly
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/recategorize-by-tags.ts --dry-run --interactive

# Or use the admin CLI
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/admin-cli.ts recategorize --dry-run --interactive
```

#### Options

- `--dry-run`: Show suggested changes without applying them (optional)
- `--interactive`: Confirm each change individually (optional)
- `--dataset`: Specify which dataset to use (default: 'default') (optional)

### Admin CLI

The admin CLI provides a unified interface for all admin utilities.

#### Usage

```bash
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/admin-cli.ts <command> [options]
```

#### Commands

- `import`: Run the batch import utility
- `recategorize`: Run the recategorization utility
- `backup`: Create a backup of the links data

### AI Tag Generation Configuration

The AI-powered tag generation feature uses OpenAI's GPT model by default but includes fallback mechanisms:

1. **OpenAI GPT**: Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment variables
2. **REST API Fallback**: If OpenAI fails or no API key is provided
3. **Local Keyword Extraction**: Works offline with no external dependencies

To customize the AI tag generation behavior, you can modify the settings in `src/lib/auto-tagger.ts`:

```typescript
// Example configuration options
const AI_TAG_CONFIG = {
  maxTags: 5,           // Maximum number of tags to generate
  minConfidence: 0.7,   // Minimum confidence score for tag inclusion
  useOpenAI: true,      // Whether to use OpenAI as primary tagger
  useFallbackAPI: true, // Whether to use REST API as fallback
  colorPalette: [       // Colors for tag badges
    "blue", "green", "red", "yellow", "purple", "pink", "orange"
  ]
};
```

## Advanced Filtering and AI Tagging

NEXUS V5 includes powerful filtering and AI-powered tagging capabilities to help users organize and discover links more effectively.

### Advanced Filtering

The `AdvancedFilters` component provides comprehensive filtering options:

- **Date Range**: Filter links by when they were added with calendar popovers and quick-select buttons
- **Popularity**: Filter by popularity score using a slider control
- **Read Status**: Filter by read, unread, or all links
- **Attachments**: Toggle to show only links with attachments
- **Tags**: Select from common tags to filter the link collection
- **Domains**: Filter by specific domains with add/remove functionality

The filters can be accessed through the sidebar on desktop or via a slide-in panel on mobile devices.
